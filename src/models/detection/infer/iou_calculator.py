def bbox_overlaps(bboxes1, bboxes2, mode='iou', is_aligned=False, eps=1e-6):
    """Calculate overlap between two set of bboxes.
    FP16 Contributed by https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/4889
    If ``is_aligned`` is ``False``, then calculate the overlaps between each
    bbox of bboxes1 and bboxes2, otherwise the overlaps between each aligned
    pair of bboxes1 and bboxes2.
    Args:
        bboxes1 (Tensor): shape (B, m, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format or empty.
        bboxes2 (Tensor): shape (B, n, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format or empty.
            B indicates the batch dim, in shape (B1, B2, ..., Bn).
            If ``is_aligned`` is ``True``, then m and n must be equal.
        mode (str): "iou" (intersection over union), "iof" (intersection over
            foreground) or "giou" (generalized intersection over union).
            Default "iou".
        is_aligned (bool, optional): If True, then m and n must be equal.
            Default False.
        eps (float, optional): A value added to the denominator for numerical
            stability. Default 1e-6.
    Returns:
        Tensor: shape (m, n) if ``is_aligned`` is False else shape (m,)
    Example:
        >>> bboxes1 = torch.FloatTensor([
        >>>     [0, 0, 10, 10],
        >>>     [10, 10, 20, 20],
        >>>     [32, 32, 38, 42],
        >>> ])
        >>> bboxes2 = torch.FloatTensor([
        >>>     [0, 0, 10, 20],
        >>>     [0, 10, 10, 19],
        >>>     [10, 10, 20, 20],
        >>> ])
        >>> overlaps = bbox_overlaps(bboxes1, bboxes2)
        >>> assert overlaps.shape == (3, 3)
        >>> overlaps = bbox_overlaps(bboxes1, bboxes2, is_aligned=True)
        >>> assert overlaps.shape == (3, )
    Example:
        >>> empty = torch.empty(0, 4)
        >>> nonempty = torch.FloatTensor([[0, 0, 10, 9]])
        >>> assert tuple(bbox_overlaps(empty, nonempty).shape) == (0, 1)
        >>> assert tuple(bbox_overlaps(nonempty, empty).shape) == (1, 0)
        >>> assert tuple(bbox_overlaps(empty, empty).shape) == (0, 0)
